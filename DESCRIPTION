Title: Simplifies plotting of database and sparklyr data
Description: Leverages dplyr to process the calculations of a plot inside a database. 
    This package provides helper functions that abstract the work at three levels:
    outputs a ggplot (highest), outputs the calculations (medium), outputs the formula
    needed to calculate bins (lowest).
